# AI-Maze-Solver

# DFS naturally handles dead-ends by backtracking, making it well-suited for maze exploration.
# Time complexity is O(N*M) , N is no.of rows & M is no.of Columns in maze
# BFS or other algorithms can't be used because they are complex and have more memory usage , they are slower compared to DFS
